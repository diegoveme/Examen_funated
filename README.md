# 📋 Web Form with LocalStorage

This project is a simple web application that allows users to enter personal data (name, email, age, and country) and store it in the browser's **LocalStorage**.  
It was developed using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and pure **Vanilla JavaScript**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user fills in all form fields.  
2. When pressing **Send**, the script validates the inputs:
   - If any field is empty → an error message appears in red and highlights the missing field.  
   - If all fields are completed → the data is stored in `localStorage`.  
3. The stored data is displayed below the form and remains even after refreshing the page.
